## Program Basics: Types, Statements, Operators, and Expressions
This lesson covers the basics of a program, which includes both data and instructions. It begins by introducing the idea of a data type.

Almost every programming language associates data with types. As we saw in Lecture 1, a value stored in memory occupies a certain number of bytes, and computer instructions are designed to operate on data of specific types. These data types and instructions are directly reflected in the C programming language.

The C language allows a developer to identify a value in memory by a symbolic name called a variable that indicates its purpose and its data type. This enables a compiler that translates a C program into computer instructions to use the appropriate instructions for the type. The term "variable" is used because the value of that memory may be changed by the program.

Next the lessson shows how C instructions in the form of statements can be executed one after another to implement a program that performs a particular task. Statements consist of expressions that combine values and operators. Operators transform input values into an output values that can be used as input to other operators. The results are ultimately stored in memory for later use. C enables writing even complicated expressons very compactly, using a notation that is similar to standard mathematical notaton.

This lesson reviews the built-in C operators for various data types, and illustrates the many ways that data and operators can be combined into expressions and statements.
