## Using Structs to Define New Types        




     

<p>
The third and final mechanism allows creating new types as heterogenous
collections of existing types. A <em>struct</em> consists of a set of named 
fields. Each field is specified by an identifier with a name and a type. 
A <em>struct</em> can be used to represent information about a real-world object
in an application, such as a book with an author, title, publisher, and 
publication date in a library management system.

In this lecture, we will learn how to define a <em>struct</em>, how to 
define and name its fields, how to initialize structs, and how to get and
set individual fields. We will also see how to create more complex data types
by embedding struct, enum, and typedef type fields within a struct. Finally, 
we will learn why it is almost always beneficial to <em>typedef</em> 
a <em>struct</em>.
