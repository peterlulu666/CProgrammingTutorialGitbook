## Arrays and Strings      

In this lesson, we will learn about arrays as a way to create collections of fixed size elements of the same type. Arrays allow implementing operatoins that operate on the entier array, as well as on individual elements.

We will begin with how an array stored in memory, and how to access the elements of an array using a non-negative index. Then we will see how to declare an array valued variable and specify the size of the array. Next, we will learn how to use multi-dimensional arrays to represent data that is naturally oriented towards this kind of representation, sucn as images.

Finally, we will learn how the C languages uses arrays to represesnt textaual information using a special type of character array called a string. Strings enable a number of operations for manuiplating string based information and well look at some of them, and create even some ourselves.
