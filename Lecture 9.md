## Using Enums to Define New Types      









<p>
The second of the three new mechanisms for defining types is the enumeration.
An enumeration defines a type in terms of a set of symbolic constants that
repesent the values of the type. For example, days of the week can be defined
in terms of their day number, but it is clearer to provide symbolic constants
that name the days, and to use those constants rather than their numeric day
numbers.

In this lecture, we will look at the use of the C language <em>enum</em> to
define enumerated types, including how to define an <em>enum</em>, how to
specify symbolic constants, how to print their values, and how to make
use of them as parameters, switches, and loop and array indexes. We will also
learn about some of the limitations and restrictions on <em>enum</em> values
in C, and why it is almost always beneficial to <em>typedef</em> an <em>enum</em>.
