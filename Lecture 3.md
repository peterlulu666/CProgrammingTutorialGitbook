## Defining and Calling Functions      

Functions are a way to create new operations that can be combined with built-in operators and other functions. There are two purposes for defining functions. One is to specify some functionality just once and then reuse it wherever it is needed, rather than repeating the same sequence of statements for each new set of values.

The other purpose is to make the program more understandable by replacing a sequence of statements with the use of a function whose name describes what it does. This is often referred to as encapsulation. The process of designing a program that breaks a complex problem into a set of functions that are easier to design, use, test, and maintain is known as functional decomposition.

In this lesson, we will learn how to define a function with formal parameters that are place-holders for actual values the function uses, and how to return the result of the function. Then we will see how to call the function with actual parameter values, and use the returned result. We will also survey a few of the libraries of pre-defined functions that C provides. Finally, we will look at a few examples of functional decomposition to understand this important design paradigm.
