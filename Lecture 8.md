## Introduction to Types and Using Typedefs to Define New Types      






In this lesson, we will look at the concept of data types, and the ways that data types can be defined in the C programming language. We will discover that there are five common ways to create new data types: references, sequences, aliases, enumerations, and aggregations.

We have already studied two of these. A pointer indirectly refers to a value through the address of the value that is stored in a pointer variable. An array is an indexable homogeneous sequence of a basic data type such as boolean, int, float, and char, or a pointer to one of those types.

In this lesson, we will learn about typedef, a way to provide programmer-defined names to existing basic types, and to composites of existing types. As we will see, being able to name new and existing types offers several benefits, including program portability on different processors and operating systems, and definitions that are more meaningful in terms application-specific concepts like Color. This greatly improves the readability of code and facitates the ability to matain and add new functionality over time.
