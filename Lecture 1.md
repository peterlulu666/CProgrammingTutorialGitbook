## Computers, Programs, and Programming Language     

This lecture presents a gentle introduction to what a computer is and how it operates. It shows the functional parts of a computer, and shows how those parts work together to carry out sequences of instructions that solve problems.

We also briefly explore what is meant by a computer program, and how the program is loaded and run by a computer.

Next, we look at how a computer programming language enables a developer to create programs. We will see that programming languages can range from low-level, corresponding to native instructions that the computer perfors, to mid-level ones that can easily be translated to native instructions, to high-level ones tha require the support of additional layeers of software.

Finally, we take a first look at the C programming language that we will use for this course, a simple, mid-level language which provides features that make it relatively simple to learn and use. It also strongly influenced several higher-level languages, including C++ and Java, that will also be used in throughout the graduate curriculum.
