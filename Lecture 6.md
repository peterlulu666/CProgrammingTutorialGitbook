## Pointers and Pointer Function Parameters
Every variable in C occupies a memory location when the program is in memory, and every location has a address. C provides a special data type known as a pointer to represent the address, and special operators for getting the address of a variable and for getting the value at that address. The pointer type and the operators provide a number of new ways for a program to access and operate on data.

In this lecture we will learn about pointers types and the address-of and value-at operators, and how to use them to implement a new type of function parameter passing scheme known as Call By Reference (CBR). We will look at several examples to understand how ponters work and ways to use CBR to implement functions that would be difficult to do in any other way. In the next lecture, we will look at other ways to use pointers for operating on arrays and strings.
