## Memory Management              




     

In this lecture, we will learn about how memory is managed in a C program, including the stack, the constant pool, and the heap. We will also learn about functions that enable us to use the C heap for dynamically creating and managing data in a this portion of memory that is independent of fixed global storage and the local storage within a given function.
