## Decision Making, Conditional Processing, and Repetition       

The sequence of instructions to perform often depends on values that were computed by previous instructions. If a certain value is less than another value, for example, one sequence of instructions applies, otherwise a different sequence of instructions is performed. The C language provides conditional processing constructs that control which sequence of instructions to perform. These constructs are controlled by logical expressions that combine built-in C logical and comparison operators and functions.

Some computations require repeating a set of instructions, using the results of previous instructions or repetitions to determine whether to continue repeating the instructions. The C language provides several conditional processing constructs called loops that repeat a set of instructions until a logical expression becomes false or while a logical expression evaluates as true.

In this lesson, we will look at the various conditional processing constructs provided by the C language, and also see how these constructs can be combined to implement more advanced conditional processing operations.
